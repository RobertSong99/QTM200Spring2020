### Interpretation
1: It seems at even low population densities, the distribution of poverty levels varies quite a bit more than the more separated population densities. It’s hard to interpret correctly, as indicated in the question with the scalar quantities being difficult to read, but it could be due to more people who struggle who live in the metropolitan area, attempting to obtain jobs, or who are unemployed, ultimately leading to more poverty levels. Whereas if one lives in the rural/suburb areas, to be able to live in those areas, it takes more to sustain properly (through distance and land as examples).

#As per capita expenditure on public education increases, so does the relationship of per capita personal income. This is illustrated by the positive relationship drawn by the trendline. The relationship could be deemed correlational because having more people with more money, leads to more money going back into the system through taxes for example, to be spent on public education. Though one must note, ss per capita expenditure on public education passes approximately 100, the relationship becomes more neutral.
