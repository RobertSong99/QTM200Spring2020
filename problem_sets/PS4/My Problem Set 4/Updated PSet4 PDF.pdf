\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Economics}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	
In this question, use the \texttt{prestige} dataset in the \texttt{car} library. First, run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
install.packages(car)
library(car)
data(Prestige)
help(Prestige)
\end{verbatim} 


\noindent We would like to study whether individuals with higher levels of income have more prestigious jobs. Moreover, we would like to study whether professionals have more prestigious jobs than blue and white collar workers.

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Create a new variable \texttt{professional} by recoding the variable \texttt{type} so that professionals are coded as $1$, and blue and white collar workers are coded as $0$ (Hint: \texttt{ifelse}.)
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=14, lastline=17]{PSet4_RCodeAnswers.R}
	\vspace{2cm}
	
	
	\item [(b)]
	Run a linear model with \text{prestige} as an outcome and \texttt{income}, \texttt{professional}, and the interaction of the two as predictors (Note: this is a continuous $\times$ dummy interaction.)
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=24, lastline=25]{PSet4_RCodeAnswers.R}
	
	\vspace{2cm}
	\item [(c)]
	Write the prediction equation based on the result.
\vspace{.5cm}

	$y = 13.90 + .00402x_{i} + 45.02D1_{i} + 18.99D2_{i} - 0.003178x_{i}D1_{i}- .0022X_{i}D2_{i}$
	
	\item [(d)]
	Interpret the coefficient for \texttt{income}.
	
	
Given the individual in the dataset, on average, as income increases by 1 dollar, the individual's prestige will go up by 0.004023 points regardless of one's profession.
	\vspace{2cm}	
	\item [(e)]
	Interpret the coefficient for \texttt{professional}.
	
	
If the individual's profession is a professional, on average, the individual's prestige will go up by 45.02 points whereas if the individuals profession is white collar, on average, the individual's prestige will go up by 18.98 points

	\newpage
	\item [(f)]
	What is the effect of a \$1,000 increase in income on prestige score for professional occupations? In other words, we are interested in the marginal effect of income when the variable \texttt{professional} takes the value of $1$. Calculate the change in $\hat{y}$ associated with a \$1,000 increase in income based on your answer for (c).
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=29, lastline=34]{PSet4_RCodeAnswers.R}
	
	The change in $\hat{y}$ associated with a \$1000 increase in income is 0.84546
	\vspace{4cm}
	
	
	\item [(g)]
	What is the effect of changing one's occupations from non-professional to professional when her income is \$6,000? We are interested in the marginal effect of professional jobs when the variable \texttt{income} takes the value of $6,000$. Calculate the change in $\hat{y}$ based on your answer for (c).
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=37, lastline=41]{PSet4_RCodeAnswers.R}
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	The change in $\hat{y}$ associated with an income of \$6000 when going to a professional status is 25.03 in prestige

\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Political Science}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	Researchers are interested in learning the effect of all of those yard signs on voting preferences.\footnote{Donald P. Green, Jonathan	S. Krasno, Alexander Coppock, Benjamin D. Farrer,	Brandon Lenoir, Joshua N. Zingher. 2016. ``The effects of lawn signs on vote outcomes: Results from four randomized field experiments.'' Electoral Studies 41: 143-150. } Working with a campaign in Fairfax County, Virginia, 131 precincts were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. In 30 precincts, signs were posted around the precinct that read, ``For Sale: Terry McAuliffe. Don't Sellout Virgina on November 5.'' \\

Below is the result of a regression with two variables and a constant.  The dependent variable is the proportion of the vote that went to McAuliff's opponent Ken Cuccinelli. The first variable indicates whether a precinct was randomly assigned to have the sign against McAuliffe posted. The second variable indicates
a precinct that was adjacent to a precinct in the treatment group (since people in those precincts might be exposed to the signs).  \\

	\textbf{Impact of lawn signs on vote share}\\

		Precinct assigned lawn signs  (n=30)  & 0.042\\
		& (0.016) \\
		Precinct adjacent to lawn signs (n=76) & 0.042 \\
		&  (0.013) \\
		Constant  & 0.302\\
		& (0.011)
		\\
		\hline \\
	\end{tabular}\\
	\footnotesize{\textit{Notes:} $R^2$=0.094, N=131}
\end{table}

\vspace{.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] Use the results to determine whether having these yard signs in a precinct affects vote share (e.g., conduct a hypothesis test with $\alpha = .05$).
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=61, lastline=70]{PSet4_RCodeAnswers.R}

With our z-score of 5.49, which does not lie within the 95\% CI range of -1.96 to 1.96, we can reject the null, that there is an affect on vote share based on having yard signs in a precinct.
	
	\item [(b)]  Use the results to determine whether being
	next to precincts with these yard signs affects vote
	share (e.g., conduct a hypothesis test with $\alpha = .05$).
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=73, lastline=82]{PSet4_RCodeAnswers.R}
	
		With our z-score of 4.24, which does not lie within the 95\% CI range of -1.96 to 1.96, we can reject the null, that there is an affect on vote share based on being next to precincts with these yard signs.
	\vspace{1.5cm}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient for the constant term substantively.	
	
	The constant (.302, with a standard error of .011) has been identified as the proportion of the vote that went to McAuliffâ€™s opponent Ken Cuccinelli. As a result, if there were no yard signs, the vote share proportion would be .302 in favor of Cuccinelli. From our data analysis, there can be a difference having the signs up for degrading McAuliff, to boost Cuccinelli's proportion of the vote share whether the method is to add the signs within certain precincts, or even be neighboring to precincts with these signs. 
\vspace{1.5cm}
	
	\item [(d)] Evaluate the model fit for this regression.  What does this	tell us about the importance of yard signs versus other factors that are not modeled?
	
	The model fit for this regression is not good, with an $R^2$ = .094, meaning, the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable, is quite low. As a result, the yard signs alone are not a good predictor of whether or not there is an impact on vote share. 
	
	One thing that I could suggest as a possible variable, is the precinct location as a whole, depending on their demographic make-up as well as their previous political voting history.
